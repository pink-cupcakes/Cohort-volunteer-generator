This application has been designed to generate random "volunteers" during lecture.

Instructions:

1. Begin by populating your classroom with the student's in the current cohort.
    //Optional: There may be optional customized fields i.e. student ID, or checkpoint result history.

2. Click on 'Generate volunteer' to provide us with the following student to be selected
    //Prepopulate with our cohort?
    //Do we want to create new databases for each classroom?
        //new schema in mongo?
        //SQL would be easier to handle this problem (TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING DB)

// 3. OPTIONAL: select groups i.e. for greenfield
      //This option will need to take an input of a limit as well as a 'generate' button
